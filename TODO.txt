*** DTT ***

development:
- add test/check_sh_errexit.sh
- add test/check_js_strict_warnings.sh
- meta/code/validation_data_export.sh define a list of forms to
  export validation data from (DRY validation data export)

wiki:
- add simple example

hints:
- think of how to DRYly include all the fields in POST when submitting the form
  from the page-specific script
- maybe define the _id definition rule in form.js?
- how to print HTML entities? (do we need them? aren't they a security threat?)
