*** DTT ***

development:
- extract validation data from forms and to validate_doc_update
  and client-side JS
- separate validation data from form?

wiki:
- add simple example

hints:
- think of how to DRYly include all the fields in POST when submitting the form
  from the page-specific script
- maybe define the _id definition rule in form.js?
- how to print HTML entities? (do we need them? aren't they a security threat?)
