### Static files ###

- "./js/" - static Javascript files to be included in pages; almost nothing special;
- "./tests/" - acceptance tests and their sandbox/framework/no-idea-how-to-call-that;
- "./validation_data/" - holds the validation data extracted from meta-forms
  that will be used for client-side validation.
