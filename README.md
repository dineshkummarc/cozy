# Cozy: an application development framework on top of CouchDB and CouchApp

This framework is trying to DRY-up last drop of dupplication from the development process. It is uses JSON as much as possible for applicaton meta-data.

**Notes**

- This is a work in progress;
- The shell scripts are Bourne Shell scripts written on FreeBSD.
