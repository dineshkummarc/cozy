*** DTT ***

development:
- write integration tests for Author page (from gn);
- metadata tests (syntactic?);

wiki:
- add simple example

hints:
- think of how to DRYly include all the fields in POST when submitting the form
  from the page-specific script
- maybe define the _id definition rule in form.js?
- how to print HTML entities? (do we need them? aren't they a security threat?)
